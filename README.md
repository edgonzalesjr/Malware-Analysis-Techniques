## Objective

Develop comprehensive cybersecurity skills by understanding malware analysis techniques, investigating and assessing suspicious URLs, evaluating IP reputation through multiple sources, and leveraging threat intelligence resources to enhance threat detection, response, and overall security strategy.

### Skills Learned

- Identify and analyze malware files to detect Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Utilize various malware analysis tools to gain insights into malware behavior and characteristics.
- Interpret analysis results to aid in cybersecurity investigations
- Evaluate and gather context about suspicious URLs to assess their safety and legitimacy.
- Employ various tools for URL analysis, from sandboxed browsing to visual screenshot capture.
- Analyze the reputation and historical usage of IP addresses to determine their potential threat level.
- Integrate information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive context.
- Collect and utilize threat intelligence data to improve threat detection and response capabilities.
- Understand and validate threat indicators from multiple sources.

### Tools Used
