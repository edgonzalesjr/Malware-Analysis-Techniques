<br/>
<b>Don't overlook the community comments, they can provide valuable insights into the IOC we're investigating.</b>
<br/>

- Hybrid Analysis
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/K3juvA1.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Device Specification"/>
<br/>
<b>Hybrid Analysis is a popular malware analysis tool that can sandbox and analyze malicious software and executables. By uploading a file or submitting a URL, users can leverage this technology to collect data and receive a detailed report on the findings.</b>
<br/>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3HqPk0I.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Device Specification"/>
<br/>
<b>One nice feature is that users can actually choose which operating system you want the file or URL to be sandboxed in.</b>
<br/>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L4P1u7m.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Device Specification"/>
<br/>
<b>We have the option to select for a quick scan and the scan will then integrate CrowdStrike Falcon static analysis and MetaDefender.</b>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Once it's done, users can choose to generate a public report and if someone else searches for the same indicator of compromise, the same report will be shared to them as well.</b>
<br/>

#### URL Investigation Tools

- Browserling
<p align="center">

<br/>
<b></b>
<b>To start, enter your URL of interest, select the operating system, browser type, version, then click "Test Now". You may then observe the URL of interest's output or behavior for additional context regarding the incident.</b>
<br/>

- URL Scan

<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uk05kcn.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="Device Specification"/>
<br/>
<b>URL scan literally scans your URL and outputs the information, like where it is located and belongs to.</b>
<br/>

#### IP Reputation Tools

- AbuseIPDB
